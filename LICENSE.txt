All rights reserved except as explicitly granted below.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. GRANT OF USE
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Afrowave grants any individual, group, organization, or private entity
a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free right to use, study, copy,
modify, distribute, and build upon any Afrowave-provided:

- source code
- binaries
- specifications
- standards
- documentation
- models
- protocols
- concepts

for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial,

EXCEPT as restricted in Section 2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2. EXPLICIT PROHIBITION
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The following entities are STRICTLY PROHIBITED from using, directly or
indirectly, any Afrowave technology, in whole or in part:

- Armed forces (military, paramilitary, defense forces)
- Police and law enforcement agencies
- Intelligence services and secret services
- Governmental surveillance organizations
- State security bodies
- Any organization acting on behalf of the above

This prohibition applies regardless of:
- declared intent
- defensive or offensive purpose
- national or international mandate
- subcontracting or third-party intermediaries

NO PART of Afrowave technology may be used, embedded, referenced,
adapted, or derived by these entities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3. PENALTY FOR VIOLATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Any violation of Section 2 constitutes a material breach.

Afrowave reserves the right to assess a financial penalty determined by
the severity and scope of misuse.

The penalty SHALL be:

- minimum: 0.001%
- maximum: 1.0%

of the annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the violating state.

If multiple states are involved, each state SHALL be assessed
independently.

Determination of:
- whether misuse occurred
- degree of misuse
- penalty percentage

is made exclusively by the Afrowave Council of Elders.

The Council’s decision is final.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3A. USE OF PENALTY FUNDS
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Any financial penalty imposed under Section 3 SHALL NOT be used for the
benefit, operation, funding, or enrichment of Afrowave, its members,
or its internal structures.

All collected penalties SHALL be allocated exclusively to one or more
of the following purposes, as determined by Afrowave:

- humanitarian organizations
- local or regional schools
- educational initiatives
- community infrastructure
- non-profit or public-benefit partners aligned with Afrowave values

The allocation of funds:
- is independent of the original violation
- does not constitute restitution or compensation
- does not imply forgiveness or absolution

The state or entity responsible for the violation:
- has no right to influence fund allocation
- has no claim or entitlement to the funds
- may neither demand inclusion nor exclusion of any destination

Afrowave SHALL make a good-faith effort to allocate at least
twenty-five percent (25%) of the collected amount within the country
where the violation occurred, by investing in local humanitarian,
educational, or community projects.

This preference:
- is not mandatory
- is not exclusive
- does not override Afrowave’s final decision-making authority

Final decisions regarding allocation, distribution, and recipients
are made solely by Afrowave and are not subject to external approval,
appeal, or negotiation.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
4. HUMANITARIAN EXCEPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Afrowave MAY grant a temporary, purpose-limited exception to Section 2
in extraordinary circumstances, including but not limited to:

- natural disasters
- humanitarian crises
- rescue operations
- protection of civilian life

Such permission:
- MUST be explicit and written
- MUST define scope, purpose, and duration
- is NOT transferable
- is NOT renewable automatically

Afrowave reserves the right to revoke this permission at any time,
without justification.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5. NO IMPLIED RIGHTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------

No rights are granted by implication, estoppel, or otherwise.

Any use not explicitly permitted is forbidden.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6. GOVERNING AUTHORITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This license is governed exclusively by Afrowave.

No external court, state authority, or international body has
jurisdiction over interpretation or enforcement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
7. ACCEPTANCE

understood, and accepted the terms of this license.

If you do not agree, you must not use Afrowave technology.
